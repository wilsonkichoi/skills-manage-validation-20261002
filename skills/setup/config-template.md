# Project development conventions

Drop any field above that does not apply to this project. The `prd_file`, `spec_file`, and
`roadmap_file` paths are where those documents belong; the `research`, `architect`, and `plan` skills create
them later, so they can point at files that do not exist yet.

## Conventions

Free text. Anything the fields cannot capture: branch naming, review expectations, deploy steps,
who merges, what "done" means here.

## Tracker notes

Anything about this project's tracker that does not match what the skills expect, written down so
it is a decision you can come back to rather than a surprise later. `setup` adds a note here when
it finds something, and leaves the section out when it does not.

The case that produces one today: a Linear team carrying a status outside the seven this skill set
uses. Tickets parked in it are invisible to `next` and are reported as unmapped, so the note names
the status and what it means for the project. Resolve it by deleting the status in Linear, by
folding those tickets into one of the seven, or by deciding to live with it.

## Rules

Every Markdown file under the configured `rules_dir` is a discovered rule file. There is no
registry: nothing has to point at a rule for it to be found, and dropping a file into `rules_dir`
is the whole act of adding a rule.
